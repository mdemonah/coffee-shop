			      <p>Our country took a turning point in the last decade of the 18th century with the start of the coffee industry. And if you have ever wondered “why 1820?” the answer is in the year we exported our first “golden bean” to Panama. Since then, part of the Costa Rican economy has revolved around the production and consumption of the very best coffee.<br/><br/>

                  At present, some 93,000 hectares are dedicated to coffee growing. Our wide variety of soils, altitudes, and climates has led to the adaptation of different plant varieties to the highlands – like what has happened with Cafe 1820’s coffee, which grows at intermediate altitudes of 1,100 meters above sea level to satisfy the most demanding tastes.</p>

				  <h2>WHAT MAKES US <b>UNIQUE?</b></h2>
		    
			      <p>Our essence. The Café 1820 you enjoy is a balanced mix of Café Oro, which uses coffee from the 7 coffee-producing areas in Costa Rica. Ours is high-altitude coffee grown in nutrient-rich volcanic soils located at more than 1000 meters above sea level – preselected coffee rated by means of a cupping analysis by an expert coffee taster.</p>

				  <h2>GROUND CAFÉ 1820’S MAGIC</h2>
		    
			      <p>Ground Café 1820′s magic lies in its being a 100% aromatic coffee characterizing the very best of Costa Rican coffees. Café 1820’s color is what ground coffee should look like, thanks to a pre-established grade of roasting controlled hour by hour by Café 1820 experts to highlight the coffee qualities of both the dry ground and prepared coffee and guarantee consistency.</p>

			      <p>With Café 1820 you’ll enjoy the proper grind (size of the ground coffee particles), which strongly affects taste when infusing or brewing coffee, since the wrong grind gives poorly brewed coffee, detracting from its great taste. What makes our coffee an incredibly good drink is its taste – the taste of 100% pure coffee free of the undesirable “burnt” undertones found in ground coffees mixed with sugar.

                  The taste of Café 1820 is a balance of sweetness and acidity, leaving a pleasant sensation on the tongue, even when taken without sugar. It provides a characteristically fine bitterness, differentiating it from other coffees on the market and evincing the superiority of the raw materials used in its preparation.</p>
